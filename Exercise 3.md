## Minimum
The previous chapter introduced the standard function Math.min that re-
turns its smallest argument. We can do that ourselves now. Write a
function min that takes two arguments and returns their minimum.

### My Solution
```sh
function min (a,b) {
	if (a > b ) {
		console.log(b);
	} else {
		console.log(a);
	}
}

```
